# A-FMM

This is a Python implementation the Aperiodic-Fourier Modal Method, a fully vectorial method for solving Maxwell equations that combines a Fourier-based mode solver and a scattering matrix recursion algorithm to model full 3D structures. This approach is well suited to calculate modes, transmission, reflection, scattering and absorption of multi-layered structures. Moreover, support for Bloch modes of periodic structures allows for the simulation of photonic crystals or waveguide Bragg gratings.

## Installation
As for now, the advised way of installing is to just clone the repository and add it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

## Documentation
Full documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://a-fmm.readthedocs.io)
